# TRAILES 
Repo for summer camp cabin and activity signup, along with journals and peer to peer messaging

whenever you clone this project or pull to update on a different computer you'll want to do two commands

dotnet restore

dotnet build

check if .vscode folder is in your directory
    if not, restart vscode and it should prompt to make the folder

    if so, you should be good to run through vscode with CTRL+F5

If the above doesn't work, make sure you have the requisite libraries for entity framework and the like installed
